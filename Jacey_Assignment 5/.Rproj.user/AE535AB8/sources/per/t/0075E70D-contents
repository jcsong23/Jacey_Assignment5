# I assumed unequal variance and two tailed test

# From this t-test, we can confidently reject the null because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, even when you consider it as a two-tailed test.
# This means that phonological and semantic primes resulted significantly different accuracy results.

# The shapiro test shows us that the different distribution, prior to taking out outliers, is roughly normal. The points roughly fall on a straight line, and it passes through O

# The test of assumptions does not change my conclusion about the validity of the t-test. From our analysis so far, it seems like people retrieve words that relate phonologically from memory much more accurately than for semantically related words. Phonological words help in retrieval.
